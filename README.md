# Deep Learning Coursework

Welcome to the Deep Learning Coursework repository. This repository includes practical sessions and a mini project, each designed to explore various deep learning techniques, from building models from scratch to deploying them using modern frameworks.

## Practical Sessions

### TP-01: Training MLP from Scratch
In this session, we construct a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from the ground up using Python and NumPy. This exercise aims to provide a deep understanding of the core components of an MLP, including forward and backward propagation.

### TP-02: MLP with Keras and Hyperparameter Optimization
This session involves implementing an MLP using the Keras framework. Additionally, we perform hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune parameters such as learning rate, number of neurons, and batch size to enhance model performance.

### TP-03: CNN from Scratch
In this session, we create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. We manually implement convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers using Python, and then compare the performance with Keras-based implementations.

### TP-04: Transfer Learning
We explore Transfer Learning by utilizing pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet, fine-tuning them on a custom dataset. This approach significantly boosts model performance and reduces training time by leveraging existing pre-trained knowledge.

## Mini Project: Semantic Segmentation & Streamlit Deployment
The mini project focuses on Semantic Segmentation using advanced deep learning architectures. After training the model, we deploy it using Streamlit to create a simple web application for real-time image segmentation.
